it's the graphical interface that the user must use to see and edit the map.
it's basically a picture box where we make an image inside and show it to the user.
the map editer do/handles almost everything.








Shown Image :
what the user see most of the time is the image assigned to the picture box and nothing else.

when the user add an object, move an object or move the map :
the image inside the picture box IS NOT modified. when needed (in mousemove event or from a timer) a Graphics object is made from picturebox.CreateGraphics() and this object
is used to draw things on the picturebox. things draw with this object are temporary and will "go away" when the picture box will be refreshed.

for addmode and moving objects, the cercle/rectangle that follow the mouse are inside the mousemove.
for moving the map, it's from a timer at the bottom of the file.

the RefreshImage void begins by drawing the links and THEN it sraw the object. so links are under the objects and objects are not hidden because of the links.






there are two central function that convert coordinates between ui and virtual and these functions are ConvertUiToVirtual  and  ConvertVirtualToUi.
the vertical virtual Y axis is not reversed. this means that y positive is ~"up" (upwards ?) and y negative is ~"down" (downwards ?)






keys events are recorded by Form1. Form1 has KeyPreview. when Form1 receive an keyup/down events, it call the KeyUp/KeyDown voids of the map editer.
